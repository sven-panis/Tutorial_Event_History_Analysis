Nevertheless, it is useful to try to understand the relationship between different levels while all the time respecting the autonomy of each. We report a program of research that uses the theoretical concepts of coordination dynamics and quantitative measurements of simple, well-defined experimental model systems to explicitly relate neural and behavioral levels of description in human beings. Our approach is both top-down and bottom-up and aims at ending up in the same place: top-down to derive behavioral patterns from neural fields, and bottom-up to generate neural field patterns from bidirectional coupling between astrocytes and neurons. Much progress can be made by recognizing that the two approaches--reductionism and emergentism--are complementary. A key to understanding is to couch the coordination of very different things--from molecules to thoughts--in the common language of coordination dynamics.},

Posner, 1978), in which conclusions about human information processing are reached through measures of Ss' reaction time, (RT), has contributed substantially to studies of cognition and action. During the evolution of the chronometric paradigm, issues that have emerged include (a) the existence of separable processing stages, (b) the degree to which various stages of processing produce partial outputs before they are completed, and (c) the discrete vs continuous form of the outputs. To obtain added temporal resolution, new RT procedures have been developed, including special response-priming and speed-accuracy decomposition techniques that focus on quantitative patterns of RT distributions and error rates. The authors summarize these developments, starting with a historical review of chronometric research and present a survey of recent empirical and theoretical innovations.

  abstract = {In this Methods article, we discuss and illustrate a unifying, principled way to analyze response time data from psychological experiments---and all other types of time-to-event data. We advocate the general application of discrete-time event history analysis (EHA) which is a well-established, intuitive longitudinal approach to statistically describe and model the shape of time-to-event distributions. After discussing the theoretical background behind the so-called hazard function of event occurrence in both continuous and discrete time units, we illustrate how to calculate and interpret the descriptive statistics provided by discrete-time EHA using two example data sets (masked priming, visual search). In case of discrimination data, the hazard analysis of response occurrence can be extended with a microlevel speed-accuracy trade-off analysis. We then discuss different approaches for obtaining inferential statistics. We consider the advantages and disadvantages of a principled use of discrete-time EHA for time-to-event data compared to (a) comparing means with analysis of variance, (b) other distributional methods available in the literature such as delta plots and continuous-time EHA methods, and (c) only fitting parametric distributions or computational models to empirical data. We conclude that statistically controlling for the passage of time during data analysis is equally important as experimental control during the design of an experiment, to understand human behavior in our experimental paradigms.},

After cueing one of the four ends of two horizontally or vertically oriented rectangles the arrow typically appears at the cued location (valid), or sometimes at an uncued location in the same (invalid-same) or other rectangle (invalid-different). The data point to a multiple-route model in which (a) an informative cue generates response channel activation before arrow signals emerge, (b) the task-irrelevant arrow location is represented in multiple egocentric and allocentric reference frames around 150 ms after target onset, with the former including a reference frame centered on the currently attended location, (c) the task-irrelevant spatial codes activate premature response tendencies that are actively inhibited to allow gating of arrow direction signals, (d) after an invalid cue the onset of the arrow triggers an ``attention shift'' -- acting between 150 and 240 ms after target onset -- that strongly interferes with task performance in certain conditions (invalid-same cueing with horizontal rectangles, and invalid-different cueing with vertical rectangles), and (e) participants differ in which task-irrelevant codes they preferentially inhibit. These results pave the way for future confirmatory studies to temporally characterize and disentangle the contributions of different types of response channel activation processes, from those of reactive cognitive control processes including active and selective response suppression.},

Fragmented object outlines were repeatedly presented until correct naming occurred (maximum 10 times), and the fragments increased in length with every repetition. We studied how shape complexity, object category, and fragment curvature influence the timing of correct object identification. The results of a survival analysis are consistent with the idea that deficits in recurrent processing between low- and high-level visual object representations can cause category-selective impairments.},

  abstract = {Thanks to the work of Anne Treisman and many others, the visual search paradigm has become one of the most popular paradigms in the study of visual attention. However, statistics like mean correct response time (RT) and percent error do not usually suffice to decide between the different search models that have been developed. Recently, to move beyond mean performance measures in visual search, RT histograms have been plotted, theoretical waiting time distributions have been fitted, and whole RT and error distributions have been simulated. Here we promote and illustrate the general application of discrete-time hazard analysis to response times, and of micro-level speed--accuracy tradeoff analysis to timed response accuracies. An exploratory analysis of published benchmark search data from feature, conjunction, and spatial configuration search tasks reveals new features of visual search behavior, such as a relatively flat hazard function in the right tail of the RT distributions for all tasks, a clear effect of set size on the shape of the RT distribution for the feature search task, and individual differences in the presence of a systematic pattern of early errors. Our findings suggest that the temporal dynamics of visual search behavior results from a decision process that is temporally modulated by concurrently active recurrent object recognition, learning, and cognitive control processes, next to attentional selection processes.},

Survival analysis was used to investigate whether and when different types of information---such as contour integration cues (proximity, collinearity, and fragment density), fragment properties (low vs. high curvature), stimulus complexity (global symmetry, number and saliency of the parts), and memory factors (natural vs. artifactual)---influenced the timing of identification. The results show that the importance of these different types of information can change over the time course of object identification, indicating so-called time-course contingencies. Most important, the straight segments of a contour played a larger role for complex outlines with high part saliency during early (bottom-up) grouping processes, whereas the curved segments of object outlines were more important during later (top-down) matching processes for simpler outlines with lower part saliency. This new insight can explain why different studies on shape-based object identification have produced seemingly contradictory results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Here we analyze the shape of behavioral RT and accuracy distributions in a visual masked priming paradigm. We employ discrete time hazard functions of response occurrence and conditional accuracy functions to study what causes the negative compatibility effect (NCE)---faster responses and less errors in inconsistent than in consistent prime target conditions---during the time course of a trial. Experiment 1 compares different mask types to find out whether response-relevant mask features are necessary for the NCE. After ruling out this explanation, Experiment 2 manipulates prime mask and mask target intervals to find out whether the NCE is time-locked to the prime or to the mask. We find that (a) response conflicts in inconsistent prime target conditions are locked to target onset, (b) positive priming effects are locked to prime onset whereas the NCE is locked to mask onset, (c) active response inhibition is selective for the primed response, and (d) the type of mask has only modulating effects. We conclude that the NCE is neither caused by automatic self-inhibition of the primed response due to backward masking nor by updating response-relevant features of the mask, but by active mask-triggered selective inhibition of the primed response. We discuss our results in light of a recent computational model of the role of the BG in response gating and executive control.},

To study the within-trial time course of the IOR and facilitation effects we employ discrete-time hazard and conditional accuracy analyses to analyze the shapes of the RT and accuracy distributions measured in two experimental tasks. Our distributional analyses show that (a) IOR is present only from {\textasciitilde}160 ms to {\textasciitilde}280 ms after target onset for cue-target SOAs above {\textasciitilde}200 ms, (b) facilitation does not precede IOR, but co-occurs with it, (c) the cue-triggered motor response activation is selectively and actively inhibited before target onset, (d) the IOR effect consists of a facilitatory and an inhibitory component when compared to central cueing, (e) the addition of an extra central cue causes a temporary negative cueing effect in the conditional accuracy functions, and (f) the within-trial time course of IOR is not affected much by the task employed (detection or localization).

To test the explanation that the NCE is actually a positive priming effect elicited by mask features associated with the prime-opposed response, we devise masks that always point in the same direction as the prime, eliminating all antiprime features. We find large positive priming effects for arrow primes without masks and for arrow masks without primes. When a neutral mask is introduced, priming effects turn negative at long SOAs. In the critical case where the mask is an arrow in the same direction as the prime, the prime does not add to the positive priming effect from the mask shape, but instead strongly diminishes it and induces response errors even though all stimuli point in the same direction. No such feature-free inhibition is seen when arrows are replaced by color stimuli. We conclude that even though response activation by stimulus features plays a role in the NCE, there is a strong inhibitory component (though perhaps not in all feature domains) that is not based on visual features.},

  abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology's lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

  abstract = {For a long time, it has been known that one can tradeoff accuracy for speed in (presumably) any task. The range over which one can obtain substantial speed-accuracy tradeoff varies from 150 msec in some very simple perceptual tasks to 1,000 msec in some recognition memory tasks and presumably even longer in more complex cognitive tasks. Obtaining an entire speed-accuracy tradeoff function provides much greater knowledge concerning information processing dynamics than is obtained by a reaction- time experiment, which yields the equivalent of a single point on this function. For this and other reasons, speed-accuracy tradeoff studies are often preferable to reaction-time studies of the dynamics of perceptual, memory, and cognitive processes. Methods of obtaining speed-accuracy tradeoff functions include: instructions, payoffs, deadlines, bands, response signals (with blocked and mixed designs), and partitioning of reaction time. A combination of the mixed-design signal method supplemented by partitioning of reaction times appears to be the optimal method.},

abstract = { We propose a general discrete time model for multilevel event history data. The model is developed for the analysis of longitudinal repeated episodes within individuals where there are multiple states and multiple types of event (competing risks) which may vary across states. The different transitions are modelled jointly to allow for correlation across transitions in unobserved individual risk factors. Implementation of the methodology using existing multilevel models for discrete response data is described. The model is applied in an analysis of contraceptive use dynamics in Indonesia where transitions from two states, contraceptive use and nonuse, are of interest. A distinction is made between two ways in which an episode of contraceptive use may end: a transition to nonuse or a switch to another method. Before adjusting for covariate effects, there is a strong negative residual correlation between the hazards of a transition from use to nonuse and from nonuse to use; this correlation is due to a tendency for short periods of nonuse after a birth to be followed by long periods of using the same contraceptive method. }
